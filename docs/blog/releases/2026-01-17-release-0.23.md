## Breaking Changes

:::caution
This release includes breaking changes to integer and string conversion methods.
:::

### Removed Base Parameters from `.to_s()` and `.to_i()`

The `.to_s()` and `.to_i()` methods no longer accept optional base parameters. This functionality was broken and has been removed in favor of the new explicit `.base()` and `.to_base()` methods.

**Before (v0.22.x and earlier):**
```js
num = 1234
num.to_s(2)   // Would convert to binary string
num.to_s(8)   // Would convert to octal string

str = "1010"
str.to_i(2)   // Would parse as binary
```

**Now (v0.23.0):**
```js
// to_s() always returns decimal string representation
num = "0b1010".to_i()   // Integer with base 2
num.to_s()              // Returns "10" (decimal value)

// Use .to_base() for base conversion
num.to_base(8)          // Returns 0o12 (octal integer)
num.to_base(16).to_s()  // Returns "a" (hex string)

// String parsing preserves base information
str = "0b1010"
int_val = str.to_i()    // Integer with base 2, value 10
int_val.base()          // Returns 2
```

This change makes integer conversion behavior more predictable and fixes bugs related to base handling.


## New Features

### Matrix Object Type
You can now work with matrices natively in RocketLang. This release introduces a new matrix object type with support for matrix multiplication, addressing issue [#64](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/issues/64).

```js
// Create matrices from nested arrays
m1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]].to_m()
m2 = [[5, 6], [7, 8]].to_m()

// Matrix multiplication
result = m1 * m2

// Element-wise operations
sum = m1 + m2
diff = m2 - m1

puts(result)
// Output:
// 2x2 matrix
// ┌            ┐
// │ 19.0  22.0 │
// │ 43.0  50.0 │
// └            ┘
```

See [Matrix](/docs/literals/matrix) for more information about matrix operations and methods.

### Variable Unpacking on Assignment
You can now unpack multiple return values directly into variables, making it easier to work with functions that return multiple values (issue [#112](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/issues/112)).

```js
// Unpack multiple values at once
a, b, c = some_function()
x, y = [1, 2]
```

This feature greatly simplifies code that needs to handle multiple return values.

### Optional Parentheses for Control Expressions
Control flow expressions are now more flexible. Following issue [#203](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/issues/203), you can now omit parentheses around conditions in `if`, `while`, and other control structures.

```js
// Both styles are now valid
if condition
  puts("No parentheses needed!")
end

if (condition)
  puts("Parentheses still work too!")
end
```

### Integer Base Handling
Integers now carry their base information internally and provide new methods to work with different number bases:

- `.base()` - Returns the base of an integer (2, 8, 10, or 16)
- `.to_base(INTEGER)` - Converts an integer to a different base representation

```js
// Integers now remember their base when created from strings
binary_num = "0b1010".to_i()
binary_num.base()      // Returns 2

// Convert between bases while preserving the value
octal = binary_num.to_base(8)   // Returns 0o12
hex = binary_num.to_base(16)    // Returns 0xa
```

See [Integer](/docs/literals/integer) for more information.

## Improvements

### Better `puts` Behavior
The `puts` function has been improved (some would say it was broken before) to behave more consistently across different scenarios (fixing issue [#170](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/issues/170)).

## Bug Fixes

### Integer Downcast Prevention
Fixed an issue where integers could be incorrectly downcast, potentially leading to data loss. Your numeric operations are now safer and more reliable.

### Array `.pop()` Safety
Fixed a panic that occurred when calling `.pop()` on an empty array (issue [#166](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/issues/166)). The method now handles empty arrays gracefully.

### Dependency Updates
All dependencies have been updated to their latest versions, ensuring better security and performance.

## Documentation Updates
The documentation site has been updated to Docusaurus 3.9, providing a better reading experience and improved navigation.
