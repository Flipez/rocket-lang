## Improvements
### Add JSON Literal
It is now possible to parse a string via the `JSON` literal and creating an RocketLang object (array or hash) from it.

```js
ðŸš€ > JSON.parse('{"test": 123}')
=> {"test": 123.0}

ðŸš€ > JSON.parse('["test", 123]')
=> ["test", 123.0]
```

See [JSON](/docs/literals/json) for more information.

### Support for Single Quotes (`'`)
You can now use single-quotes to create a string additionally to the already existing double-quotes. This allows more flexibility in creating rich content like json.

```js
'test "string" with doublequotes'
```

### Escape double-quotes in double-quoted string

:::caution
This feature is in an early beta stage and does not support other escape sequences
::::

Insinde a string created with double-quotes `"` you can escape a single double-quote to create strings more flexible.

```js
"te\"st" == 'te"st'
```

## Removed
### next and break argument
This version removes the ability in break and next to submit an argument as it did not work reliable and intuitive.

In order to update your program to this version you need to make the following adjustments:

```js {3,10}
foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    next(i)
  end
  puts(i)
end

foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    break(i)
  end
  puts(i)
end
```

needs to change to:

```js {3,10}
foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    next
  end
  puts(i)
end

foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    break
  end
  puts(i)
end
```
