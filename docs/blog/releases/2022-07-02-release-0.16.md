## Features
### HTTP builtin added
The `HTTP` builtin has been added which allows to create a builtin webserver
and handle incoming requests.

See [HTTP](/docs/builtins/http) for more information.

### Add Ability to marshal Objects to JSON Strings
You can now use `.to_json()` to various objects in order to convert them to
their JSON respresentation.

See [JSON](/docs/builtins/json) for more information.

### Support for Next and Break
Within a loop you can now use `break` and `next` for complex control flows.

```js
foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    next("next")
  end
  puts(i)
end

foreach i in 5
  if (i == 2)
    break("break")
  end
  puts(i)
end

// Returns

0
1
3
4
0
1
"break"
```

### Allow String Multiplication
Support for repeating a string by a given number using the `*` operator has been added.

```js
ðŸš€ > "test" * 2
=> "testtest"
```

### Allow Integer Iteration

An Integer can now be iterated.

```js
ðŸš€ > foreach i in 5 { puts(i) }
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
```

### Support for Modulo Operator
Modulo has been added as valid operator.

```js
ðŸš€ > 5 % 3
=> 1
```

### Support for Ternery Operator
It is now possible to use the `?` operator.

```js
ðŸš€ > 4 > 3 ? true : false
=> true
```

### While Loop
:::info

:::

Support for `while` has been added.

```js
ðŸš€ > a = 0
ðŸš€ > while (a != 4)
  puts(a)
  a = a + 1
end
// which prints
0
1
2
3
=> nil
```

## Improvements
### Add Shorthand to convert Float to Integer
:::info
Contribution by [RaphaelPour](https://github.com/RaphaelPour)
:::

The `.plz_i()` method has been added to the Float object.

```js
ðŸš€ > a = 123.456
=> 123.456
ðŸš€ > a.plz_i()
=> 123
```

### Fix Object Index and add support for Index Range
:::info
Contribution by [MarkusFreitag](https://github.com/MarkusFreitag)
:::

The index operator `[]` has been fixed for many objects and now supports also ranges.

```js
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts(a[2])
puts(a[-2])
puts(a[:2])
puts(a[:-2])
puts(a[2:])
puts(a[-2:])
puts(a[1:-2])

// should output
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[3, 4, 5]
[4, 5]
[2, 3]
[1, 2, 8, 9, 5]
```

### Return written bytes on FILE.write
If you write to a file it now returns the written bytes instead of `true`.
