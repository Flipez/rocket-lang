We're excited to announce RocketLang v0.22.0, featuring significant improvements to array handling, better error messages, and the introduction of the rocket-range syntax for loops.

## Breaking Changes

:::caution
This release includes breaking changes to array method names.
:::

### Array Method Renames: `.yeet()` and `.yoink()` → `.pop()` and `.push()`

To improve code readability and align with common programming conventions, we've renamed the array manipulation methods:

- `.yoink()` is now `.pop()` - Removes and returns the last element
- `.yeet()` is now `.push()` - Adds an element to the end

**Before (v0.21.x and earlier):**
```js
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.yeet(4)      // Add element
last = a.yoink() // Remove last element
```

**Now (v0.22.0):**
```js
a = [1, 2, 3]
a.push(4)      // Add element
last = a.pop()  // Remove last element
```

While the old names were fun, the new names are more intuitive for developers familiar with other programming languages.

## New Features

### Array `.sum()` Method
Calculate the sum of numeric array elements with the new `.sum()` method:

```js
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = numbers.sum()  // Returns 15

mixed = ['1', 2, 2.5]
mixed.sum()  // Returns 5.5 (strings are converted)
```

The method handles integers, floats, and numeric strings automatically.

### Array `.join()` Method
Join array elements into a string with an optional separator:

```js
words = ["Hello", "RocketLang", "World"]
words.join()       // Returns "HelloRocketLangWorld"
words.join(" ")    // Returns "Hello RocketLang World"
words.join(", ")   // Returns "Hello, RocketLang, World"

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.join("-")  // Returns "1-2-3"
```

### Rocket-Range Syntax
Introduce cleaner range syntax for `foreach` loops with the new rocket-range operator (`->`):

```js
// Exclusive range (0 to 4)
foreach i in 0 -> 5
  puts(i)
end

// Inclusive range (0 to 5)
foreach i in 0 => 5
  puts(i)
end

// With stepping using the ^ operator
foreach i in 0 -> 10 ^ 2
  puts(i)  // 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
end
```

See [Foreach](/docs/control_expressions/foreach) for more information.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Error Messages
Error messages now include precise `file:line:pos` information, making debugging much easier. You'll see exactly where errors occur in your code with accurate line and position information.

### Type Conversion Refactoring
Internal type conversion methods have been refactored for better consistency and reliability across different object types.

## Bug Fixes

### `break` Support in `while` Loops
The `break` statement now works correctly in `while` loops, contributed by [MarkusFreitag](https://github.com/MarkusFreitag) in PR [#168](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/pull/168).

```js
i = 0
while i < 10
  if i == 5
    break
  end
  puts(i)
  i = i + 1
end
```

## Infrastructure Updates

### Go 1.21
RocketLang now uses Go 1.21, bringing performance improvements and the latest language features.
