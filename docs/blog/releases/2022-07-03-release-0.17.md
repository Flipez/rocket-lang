## Improvements
### Introduce NIL Object
Up to this version some functions were returning `NULL`.
Now a proper `NIL` object has been added which replaces all existing `NULL`s
and is now also createable like every other object by the user.

See [NIL](/docs/literals/nil) for more information.

## Removed
### NULL has been replaced by NIL
As stated above, `NIL` is replacing `NULL`.
