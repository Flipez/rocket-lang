## New Features

### `elif` Statement
You can now use `elif` (also known as "else if") to create cleaner conditional logic with multiple conditions. This enhancement was contributed by [MarkusFreitag](https://github.com/MarkusFreitag) in PR [#198](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/pull/198).

```js
a = "test"
if a.type() == "BOOLEAN"
  puts("is a boolean")
elif a.type() == "STRING"
  puts("is a string")
elif a.type() == "INTEGER"
  puts("is an integer")
else
  puts("unknown type")
end
```

You can chain as many `elif` statements as needed, making complex conditional logic more readable and maintainable than nested `if` statements.

See [If / elif / else](/docs/control_expressions/if) for more information.
