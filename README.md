RocketLang as of version 0.9.5 is the _full_ (as in the book was worked through) version of [MonkeyLang](https://monkeylang.org/) and is then being extended with various useful and not so useful features.

Besides the MonkeyLang roots RocketLang is also heavily influenced by my personal favourite language features which are mainly from Ruby. Therefore a unusual mix of usage patterns can occure. With newly implemented feature RocketLang will drift more and more into a Ruby-like language adaptation.

**Please note:** This language is developed as a side-project to learn the inner mechanics of a interpreter language. Therefore use at your own risk and do not expect production grade stability.

If you have issues, found bugs are ideas for improvements feel free to open an issues.

## Installation

Install RocketLang using

```
brew install flipez/homebrew-tap/rocket-lang
```
or download from [releases](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/releases).

## How To?

* `rocket-lang` without any arguments will start an interactive shell
* `rocket-lang FILE` will run the code in that file (no file extension check yet)
* Use _Javascript_ Highlighting in your editor for some convenience
* Checkout Code [Samples](examples/) for what is currently possible (and what not)
