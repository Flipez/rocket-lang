# General

RocketLang as of version 0.9.5 is the _full_ (as in the book was worked through) version of [MonkeyLang](https://monkeylang.org/)

## Installation

Install RocketLang using 

```
brew install flipez/homebrew-tap/rocket-lang
```
or download from [releases](https://github.com/Flipez/rocket-lang/releases).

## How To?

* `rocket-lang` without any arguments will start an interactive shell
* `rocket-lang FILE` will run the code in that file (no file extension check yet)
* Use _Javascript_ Highlighting in your editor for some convenience
* Checkout Code [Samples](examples/) for what is currently possible (and what not)
